problems:
1) what is the distribution of the cases (is it a Gaussian) ? 

2) Are you overfitting because you have the number last week and next week. 

3) Train on the first half vs. the second half! 

4) Assume there are IID (then use typical ML methods);can also not assume this then predict the next case using the previous case.  

5) Use Mean Squared Error (but the website uses MAE) {i.e. make sure the methods we use optimize MAE not MSE, look at Sklearn's documentation) 

6) Use Elastic net, univariate multivariate test, streamwise stepwise to detect a number of features 

7) Convert everything to the same scale (everything to Kelvin)
